She's none too happy that you stole her 'About Me' section and she'd love if you'd just go ahead and take that right down. Thanks for lettin' me bend your ear, there, pardner.\nOn 6/10/2003",

I wonder if she's made it yet? And I think if not, then maybe next year, cuz that li'l gal's got plenty of gumption. I recon she'll be up in the cool, cool yonder soon enough, why shucks.\nOn 6/14/2003",

We've been riding together so long, it's like we was brothers, even despite our differences. For instance, Chops is Canadian and I am not. Also, he plays the guitar while I prefer the harmonica. And still, there ain't nobody I'd rather ride shotgun for than this here cowboy. I tip my 10 gallon to you, sir.\nOn 5/23/2003",
