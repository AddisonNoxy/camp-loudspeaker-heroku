      "Ah Crystal, I guess it's just not going to work. Doesn't seem like anyone here's interested in real sports--it's all mind, mind, mind!\nBut that's okay. How would you ever appreciate the sweet taste of victory if we didn't also know the constant, comforting tonic of failure?\nOn 6/17/2003",
      "That goes ditto for me!!! Double Ditto!!! OMFG!\nOn 5/21/2003",

Go Benny!\nOh, so anyhew... you're friends with Bobby, right? You know, he is the only person at camp who's not on our friends list. We're friends with EVERYONE else in camp. Super good friends in fact!\nOn 6/19/2003",

      "You put the YOU in Unique! You and Quentin are both winners who are decidedly different, positively popular, and outrageously outrageous!!!!\nOn 6/18/2003",
      "Yeah! Total team! With his canoeing skills and your super invisibility, together you could be like... like... Team Peek-a-boo Canoe!\nOn 5/29/2003",

      "Hey spontaneous group activities are great!\nOn 6/14/2003",
      "OMG we have so much fun at camp! This is the best year ever! I could die now and be totally happy! I'm just saying it wouldn't be a complete tragedy if we died this year, because then we would have ended on a high note!\nOn 6/19/2003",
      "Yeah, Kitty's just more unique on the outside, where we can see it. Some of us are more unique on the inside. In our hearts!\nSome of our hearts are big, and some are small, and some of them are dark, and still, and stopped beating long ago, and yet somehow we manage to slog through this shadow puppet theater day in and day out, waiting for the merciful velvet curtain of death.\nOn 6/11/2003",
